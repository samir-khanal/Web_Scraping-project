### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/samir-khanal/Web_Scraping-project.git
    cd Web_Scraping-project
    ```
2. Install Required Dependencies
    Ensure you have Python installed (‚â•3.7), then run:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Configure Authentication
    For security reasons, credentials are not included in the repository.

    **Option 1: Using a config.py file**
    Copy the example configuration file:
    ```sh
    cp config.example.py config.py
    ```
    Open config.py and set your username & password:
    ```python
    APP_USERNAME = "testuser"
    APP_PASSWORD = "testpass"
    ```

    **Option 2: Using Environment Variables (Recommended for production)**
    Instead of using config.py, set credentials as environment variables:
    ```sh
    export APP_USERNAME="testuser"
    export APP_PASSWORD="testpass"
    ```
    (For Windows users, use `set` instead of `export`.)
